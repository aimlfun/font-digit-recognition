From blog posting on https://aimlfun.com/i-recognise-that-letter/

For a pre-trained network, copy /Model/digits.ai to c:\temp.

Please note: it was trained on a specific list of 231 fonts. You may have fonts I do not.

If you don't do that, it will take more than an hour to train. If unsuccesful, it maybe a font you have isn't containing regular digits.
